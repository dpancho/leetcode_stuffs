6/23- 
Working on career artifacts today to get ready for the job hunt!!! Hopefully I can get to the practice more leetcode problems today but my main focus is knocking these things out! Lets get it done!

6/26-
Worked on artifact research and searched for job listings. Fairly laid back day. Planning on working over break to improve my coding challenge skills. 

6/29-
First day of the summer break at school. Looking into a new project to add to the porfolio. Hopefully a job will happen one day!

7/6-
Took the whole week of break to relax. Was AMAZING. Back to the grind. Lets get all these artifacts done by Wed and hopefully cleared by Fri!
Also looking into the coding challenges services to help with problems I am stuck on since I feel like I do not know anything about about coding challenges. Possibly looking at a teamtreehouse or codeacademy sign up to take their web dev courses to refresh and possible improve my skills because I feel out of touch with JS. Havent dont lots of JS or React in a while...... always try to improve and maintain. 

7/7-
Finished all artifacts except the portfolio. Will be diving in and hoping to finish that ASAP. Then..... off to coding challenges
